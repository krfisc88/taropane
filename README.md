# taropane
Electron-based open source back office management software specifically for propane delivery.

Taropane will allow businesses to create a customer database and manage their propane tanks. More functionality will be added to include options such as scheduled deliveries, efficiency reports, and more.

## Roadmap

For now, I will be adding just simple functionality to add/remove customers and tanks, as well as create the relationships between them. 

1. Implement a NoSQL customer database using MongoDB
2. Create a GUI for adding customer data
3. Create GUI for retrieving customer data
4. Implement a NoSQL database using MongoDB for tanks (Serial #s, locations, history, etc.)
5. Create GUI for for adding new tanks
6. Create GUI for retrieving tank data
